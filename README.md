# psrcplot
Package for Creating PSRC consistent data visualizations with R


## Why psrcplot?
Data visualizations can be deceptively complex to get ‘just right’. The psrcplot library provides a convenient way to create charts with standard PSRC styles, fonts and formatting–without having to specify each of those settings yourself. It uses features and styles through the ggplot2 package, with optional interactive capabilities via the plotly package. The package will also expand and evolve to keep pace with PSRC graphic design standards.
